# Git Maze

## Why?
This repository does not solve any problem, it's quite a mess to check how well you can find your way inside a git repository, it has been carefuly crafted with obscure to opaque parts of git used to make sure it's a bit harder than usual to understand a single commit id is the key to the challenge

## What should i do?
The Repository is used as part of the challenge available at this location and will hopefuly help you contact our team.

## How do i know if i'm correct?
Enter the git commit id in the form, we'll let you know.

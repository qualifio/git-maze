# Git Maze

## Why?
This repository does not solve any problem, it's quite a mess to check how well you can find 
your way inside a git repository, it has been carefuly crafted with obscure to opaque parts 
of git used to make sure it's a bit harder than usual to understand a single commit id is 
the key to the challenge

## What should i do?
The Repository is used as part of the challenge available at this location and will hopefuly 
help you contact our team.

## How do i know if i'm correct?
Enter the git commit id in the form, we'll let you know.

## What git commit id should i provide?
As soon as you don't find any pointer to a next commit, the commit you find should be the correct one.

To start, take a look at [TODO.md](TODO.md)
